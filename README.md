This is a shoping website called "StyleSavvy" Which is used to compare products between the different shopping website and help user to find their desire product at best price.

To use this code, you need to open all code files in VSCode, then use 'cd client' in the VSCode terminal, followed by 'npm start' to run the entire client file, which is the front-end part. Next, open a new terminal in VSCode, then write 'cd server' in the terminal and 'npm start' to run the entire server file. The server files contain all the project's database.

Please note that in the code, I used the 'mongodb' site to store all the data. This code will only work if you log in to the MongoDB where you uploaded all the data and add your current IP address to MongoDB.

Please note that this project is only 80% completed, as we need to add more products and features to compare products between two sites. Also, our focus is to integrate this application with my own music website 'Melody' (which is also uploaded on GitHub).
<br>
<br>
Please don't copy and paste the same code or upload it to any other website (GitHub). You can use the code for practice, but don't claim ownership of the code.
